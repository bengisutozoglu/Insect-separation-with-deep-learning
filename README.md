Insect separation with deep learning

## Abstract

Bees have an important place in today's life. There are bee species that have negative effects as well as bees 
contribute positively to nature. One of the biggest threats among these species; are wasps. They are usually found 
in flocks and attack in flocks. Wasps are harmed in many different areas. As a result of these damages, there is 
a loss of life and property. It even causes people with allergies to lose their lives. Wasps often attack honey hives 
and kill honey bees. Therefore, honey growers may be harmed. In this project, it is aimed to classify different 
images to prevent this damage. CNN (convolutional neural network), which is a deep learning method, will be 
used for classification on images. Using a data set consisting of various images, the created CNN model will be 
trained. The data set consists of 11,424 images in total. These images; 3183 belong to bees, 4943 to wasps, 2453 
to other insects and 845 to others, ie non-insect images. A convolutional neural network model will be used in 
the project. This model will be trained with 7942 training data. 1719 images will be used for level 1 verification. 
For the final verification, 1763 images will be used. Although there are important aspects to classifying these 
images, there are also aspects that can be difficult. For example; The first challenge is to distinguish bees from 
wasps.
